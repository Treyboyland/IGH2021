  title: The World Restored!
  endText: 'At the brink of total annihilation, the warring Cubians saw the heavy
    toll their never-ending war put on their planet. As CUBEWANO raged against them,
    they returned the Cubetanium to the earth, restoring the World Tree.


    The
    light from the World Tree calmed CUBEWANO''s wrath, who disappeared as mysteriously
    as they came.


    Peace has finally been achieved, and reconstruction can begin!'
