  endText: 'Through your superior ability, you were able to defeat your opponent
    as the world ended.


    CUBEWANO, seeing the husk that remained of the world
    after the war, saw fit to finish the destruction you started. The last thing
    you remember is a flash of light and a rain of Cubetanium as Polygia was reduced
    to atoms.


    But is this all that there is to the story? Can Polygia be restored
    from the brink of destruction?'
