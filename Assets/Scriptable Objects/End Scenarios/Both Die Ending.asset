  title: Mutually Assured Destruction
  endText: 'Not satisfied dying by the Omni-Cube''s wrath, the remaining Cubians
    fought until their last, eradicating themselves in a volley of Cubetanium. Polygia
    was finally at peace, a barren wasteland due to the countless battles.


    CUBEWANO,
    dissatified with the state of the planet, reduced it to atoms in a volley of
    Cubetanium, finishing the work the Cubians had started.


    But is this all
    that there is to the story? Can Polygia be restored from the brink of destruction?'
