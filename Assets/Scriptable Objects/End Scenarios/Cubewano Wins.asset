  title: CUBEWANO Wins
  endText: 'CUBEWANO''s unparalled strength obliterated the last of the warring Cubians,
    ending the war and leaving Polygia a barren, smouldering husk.


    Dissatisfied
    with the state of the world, the Omni-Cube reduced the planet to atoms in a rain
    of Cubetanium.


    But is this all that there is to the story? Can Polygia
    be restored from the brink of destruction?'
